# plastic

The aim of this repository is to make available current and scientifically validated data on plastic in the oceans. These data have been separated into two sub-folders, experimental data (**i-data**) and data obtained through simulation (**simulation**)

**On-going work** : [] add current papers in the corresponding folder

*example* for a specific paper (submitted to MPB) : "Influence of waves on the three dimensional distribution of plastic" -> simulation/data/global_3D_waves

## i-data
List of insitu data of plastic at sea and their corresponding paper.

## simulation 
List of simulations of plastic at sea and their corresponding paper.
